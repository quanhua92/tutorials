# Dynamic Programming: The Memoization Master ðŸ§©


* **`01-concepts-01-the-core-problem.md`**: Many problems involve making a series of choices where each choice affects future options. Naive recursive solutions often recompute the same subproblems millions of times.
* **`01-concepts-02-the-guiding-philosophy.md`**: Remember solved subproblems. DP identifies overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, storing solutions to avoid redundant computation.
* **`01-concepts-03-key-abstractions.md`**: The `state`, `recurrence relation`, and `memoization table`. **Analogy**: Climbing stairs where you can take 1 or 2 steps. Instead of recalculating how many ways to reach step 5 every time you need it, you write it down once and reuse it.
* **`02-guides-01-fibonacci-to-dp.md`**: Transform the exponentially slow recursive Fibonacci into a linear-time DP solution, introducing memoization and bottom-up approaches.
* **`03-deep-dive-01-recognizing-dp-problems.md`**: The art of identifying when DP applies: overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure, and how to define the state space and transitions.
