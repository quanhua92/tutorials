# Indexing: The Ultimate Table of Contents

Database indexing is one of the most impactful performance optimizations available to developers, yet it's often misunderstood or applied incorrectly. This tutorial series explains indexing from first principles, showing you how to transform slow table scans into lightning-fast queries while understanding the true costs involved.

## Summary

Indexes solve the fundamental problem of finding data quickly in large tables. Without indexes, databases must scan every row to find matches - like reading an entire book to find one topic. With proper indexing, databases can jump directly to the right data using a pre-built roadmap.

This tutorial covers the conceptual foundations, practical implementation, performance trade-offs, and real-world SQL examples needed to master database indexing. You'll learn not just how to create indexes, but when to create them and - equally important - when not to.

## What You'll Learn

**Conceptual Understanding:**
- Why full table scans are fundamentally inefficient
- How B-tree indexes enable O(log n) search performance  
- The trade-offs between read speed and write speed
- When query planners choose to use or skip indexes

**Practical Skills:**
- Creating effective single-column and composite indexes
- Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to measure index performance
- Identifying missing indexes and removing unused ones
- Optimizing bulk data loads with strategic index management

**Strategic Knowledge:**
- Calculating the real costs of index maintenance
- Designing indexes for complex query patterns
- Monitoring index effectiveness in production
- Avoiding common indexing anti-patterns

## Prerequisites

- Basic SQL knowledge (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN)
- Understanding of database tables and columns
- Familiarity with performance concepts (helpful but not required)

## Tutorial Philosophy

This tutorial follows the Feynman Technique of learning: break complex topics into simple, intuitive explanations backed by practical examples. Every concept is explained from first principles with real-world analogies, then demonstrated with measurable performance improvements.

The goal isn't just to teach you how to add indexes - it's to develop your intuition for when and how indexing improves system performance, so you can make intelligent decisions in any database environment.
