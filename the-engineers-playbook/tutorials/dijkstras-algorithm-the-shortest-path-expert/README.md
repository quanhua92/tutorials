# Dijkstra's Algorithm: The Shortest Path Expert

## Summary

Dijkstra's algorithm is a fundamental graph algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. Developed by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956, it remains one of the most important algorithms in computer science due to its efficiency, elegance, and wide applicability.

The algorithm works by greedily selecting the closest unvisited node at each step and "relaxing" the distances to its neighbors. This simple approach, combined with a priority queue, achieves optimal results in O((V + E) log V) time complexity, making it practical for real-world applications from GPS navigation to network routing.

## Why This Algorithm Matters

- **Foundational**: Forms the basis for many other graph algorithms (A*, Johnson's algorithm, etc.)
- **Practical**: Used in GPS systems, network routing, game AI, and social networks
- **Efficient**: Optimal time complexity for single-source shortest paths with non-negative weights
- **Elegant**: Demonstrates how greedy algorithms can achieve global optimality
