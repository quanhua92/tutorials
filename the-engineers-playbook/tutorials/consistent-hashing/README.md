# Consistent Hashing: Stable Distribution in a Changing World

## Overview

Consistent hashing is a distributed computing technique that solves the fundamental problem of data distribution in dynamic systems. While simple hashing (`hash(key) % N`) causes massive data reshuffling when servers are added or removed, consistent hashing ensures that only a minimal fraction of keys need to be remapped, making it essential for scalable distributed systems.

## Why Consistent Hashing Matters

In distributed systems, the ability to scale gracefully is crucial:
- **Distributed caches**: Adding cache servers without invalidating most cached data
- **Database sharding**: Redistributing data across database servers with minimal disruption
- **Load balancing**: Routing requests consistently while handling server failures
- **Content distribution**: Placing content optimally across CDN servers
- **Peer-to-peer networks**: Organizing distributed hash tables efficiently
