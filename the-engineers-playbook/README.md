## Learning Philosophy

### The Feynman Approach

Each tutorial embodies Richard Feynman's teaching philosophy:

- **Start with the problem**: What fundamental challenge does this solve?
- **Build intuition**: Use analogies and real-world examples
- **Show the mathematics**: But make it accessible and visual
- **Implement for understanding**: Code that demonstrates core concepts
- **Connect to reality**: How is this used in production systems?

### Why These Topics?

These aren't just academic exercises‚Äîthey're the building blocks of:

- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra
- **Web infrastructure**: CDNs, load balancers, caches
- **Analytics platforms**: Snowflake, BigQuery, ClickHouse  
- **Distributed systems**: Kubernetes, Kafka, Redis
- **Operating systems**: Unix/Linux, containers, virtual memory
- **Programming languages**: Compilers, interpreters, runtimes

Understanding these fundamentals helps you:
- **Debug performance issues** by understanding what's happening under the hood
- **Make better architectural decisions** by knowing the trade-offs
- **Learn new technologies faster** by recognizing familiar patterns
- **Optimize systems effectively** by understanding bottlenecks

## Getting Started

1. **Pick a tutorial** that matches your current interests or needs
2. **Read the concepts** to build foundational understanding
3. **Follow the guides** for hands-on experience
4. **Dive deep** into advanced topics when you're ready
5. **Study the implementation** to see theory in practice

Each tutorial is self-contained but benefits from understanding the broader ecosystem of data structures and algorithms.

## Philosophy: Why This Matters

In software engineering, there are no new problems‚Äîonly new applications of fundamental patterns. By deeply understanding these core concepts, you develop an intuitive sense for:

- **When to use each tool** and why
- **How to adapt patterns** to new problems  
- **What trade-offs you're making** and their implications
- **How systems will behave** under different conditions

This knowledge transforms you from someone who follows tutorials to someone who can reason about systems from first principles.
