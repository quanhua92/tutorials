# Replication: Don't Put All Your Eggs in One Basket

**Summary**: Learn how database replication eliminates single points of failure by maintaining multiple synchronized copies of your data across independent servers. This tutorial covers the fundamental concepts, practical setup procedures, and critical design decisions for building highly available database systems using PostgreSQL replication.

Database replication solves the critical problem of system availability when hardware fails, networks partition, or disasters strike. By automatically maintaining identical copies of your data on multiple servers, replication enables seamless failover, read scaling, and geographic distribution‚Äîensuring your applications remain operational even when individual components fail.

- **[01-concepts-01-the-core-problem.md](01-concepts-01-the-core-problem.md)**  
  Understand why single database servers create critical vulnerabilities and how hardware failures, network partitions, and human errors can bring down entire applications.

- **[01-concepts-02-the-guiding-philosophy.md](01-concepts-02-the-guiding-philosophy.md)**  
  Explore the fundamental principle of replication: maintaining multiple independent copies through intelligent synchronization, with transparent failover capabilities.

- **[01-concepts-03-key-abstractions.md](01-concepts-03-key-abstractions.md)**  
  Master the essential building blocks: primary/secondary roles, replication lag, failover processes, and the critical trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous replication.

### üõ†Ô∏è Section 2: Practical Guides  
- **[02-guides-01-setting-up-a-simple-replica.md](02-guides-01-setting-up-a-simple-replica.md)**
