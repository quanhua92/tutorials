# Practical Implementation: A Simple Rope in Rust

Let's build a basic Rope data structure in Rust to demonstrate the core concepts. This implementation will focus on clarity and will include methods for creation, concatenation, and character indexing.

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

// The main Rope enum. It can be a Leaf or an Internal Node.
// `Arc` is used to allow shared ownership of the underlying data,
// preventing deep copies and making operations like concatenation cheap.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
enum Rope {
    Leaf(Arc<String>),
    Node {
        left: Arc<Rope>,
        right: Arc<Rope>,
        // The `weight` is the length of the left subtree.
        // This is the key to efficient indexing.
        weight: usize,
    },
}

impl Rope {
    // Create a new Rope from a string slice.
    // For simplicity, this always creates a Leaf node.
    pub fn new(text: &str) -> Self {
        Rope::Leaf(Arc::new(text.to_string()))
    }

    // Concatenates two Ropes by creating a new Node.
    // This is an O(1) operation as it only involves creating a new
    // Node and cloning the Arcs, not copying the string data.
    pub fn concat(self, other: Rope) -> Self {
        Rope::Node {
            weight: self.len(),
            left: Arc::new(self),
            right: Arc::new(other),
        }
    }

    // Returns the total length of the text represented by the Rope.
    // This is a recursive operation that traverses the tree.
    pub fn len(&self) -> usize {
        match self {
            Rope::Leaf(s) => s.len(),
            // For a Node, the length is the sum of the lengths of its children.
            // A more optimized version might store the total length in the Node.
            Rope::Node { left, right, .. } => left.len() + right.len(),
        }
    }

    // Retrieves the character at a specific index.
    // This is an O(log n) operation for a balanced tree.
    pub fn char_at(&self, index: usize) -> Option<char> {
        match self {
            Rope::Leaf(s) => s.chars().nth(index),
            Rope::Node { left, right, weight } => {
                if index < *weight {
                    // The character is in the left subtree.
                    left.char_at(index)
                } else {
                    // The character is in the right subtree.
                    // We subtract the weight from the index to get the
                    // relative index in the right subtree.
                    right.char_at(index - *weight)
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // A simple, inefficient split operation for demonstration.
    // A production implementation would be more sophisticated.
    pub fn split(self, index: usize) -> (Rope, Rope) {
        let as_string = self.to_string();
        let (left, right) = as_string.split_at(index);
        (Rope::new(left), Rope::new(right))
    }

    // Converts the Rope to a String.
    // This is an expensive operation and should be used sparingly.
    pub fn to_string(&self) -> String {
        match self {
            Rope::Leaf(s) => s.as_ref().clone(),
            Rope::Node { left, right, .. } => {
                left.to_string() + &right.to_string()
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // 1. Create an initial rope.
    let rope = Rope::new("hello world");
    println!("Initial rope: {}", rope.to_string());
    println!("Initial length: {}\n", rope.len());

    // 2. Insert a string in the middle.
    // We do this by splitting the rope and concatenating the pieces.
    let (left, right) = rope.split(6);
    let middle = Rope::new("beautiful ");
    let final_rope = left.concat(middle).concat(right);

    println!("Final rope: {}", final_rope.to_string());
    println!("Final length: {}\n", final_rope.len());

    // 3. Access characters by index to verify.
    println!("Character at index 4: {:?}", final_rope.char_at(4));   // 'o'
    println!("Character at index 6: {:?}", final_rope.char_at(6));   // 'b'
    println!("Character at index 16: {:?}", final_rope.char_at(16)); // 'w'
}
```

### How to Run This Code

1.  Save the code to a file named `main.rs`.
2.  Run `rustc main.rs` to compile it.
3.  Run `./main` to execute it.

### Limitations of this Implementation

This simple example illustrates the power and elegance of the Rope data structure, but it is not production-ready. Here are some key limitations:

*   **No Rebalancing:** The tree is not rebalanced, so repeated, unbalanced operations (like appending one character at a time) will degrade performance to `O(n)`.
*   **Inefficient `split` and `to_string`:** The `split` and `to_string` methods are implemented by converting the entire rope to a flat string, which defeats the purpose of the rope for those operations. A proper implementation would perform these operations directly on the tree structure.
*   **Leaf Node Size:** There is no logic to manage the size of leaf nodes. A real-world rope would split leaves that get too large and join leaves that get too small to maintain efficiency.

Despite these limitations, this code provides a solid foundation for understanding the core principles of a Rope.
