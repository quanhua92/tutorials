# Consensus Algorithms: The Agreement Protocol

## Summary

Consensus algorithms solve one of the most fundamental problems in distributed systems: how can multiple independent nodes agree on a single value when communication is unreliable and nodes can fail? This tutorial explores the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and real-world trade-offs of consensus protocols, with a focus on the widely-used Raft algorithm.

You'll learn how consensus algorithms transform the chaotic world of distributed systems into orderly, democratic processes where the majority rules‚Äîeven when the network is failing around them.
