# AI-Generated Developer Tutorials

This repository offers a unique collection of AI-generated tutorials and playbooks, crafted with Claude AI models, to demystify complex software engineering concepts. Our mission is to transform intricate codebases and advanced documentation into clear, actionable, and engaging learning resources that empower you to build, understand, and innovate.

## The Engineer's Playbook: Fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms

Unlike the tutorial series which are derived from existing codebases, The Engineer's Playbook is a *ground-up, first-principles* exploration of fundamental data structures, algorithms, and system design patterns. Each entry is meticulously crafted to build deep, intuitive understanding from the ground up, focusing on the 'why' and 'how' of core engineering concepts. This series is designed to be a standalone, comprehensive resource for mastering the bedrock of software engineering.

## Playbook Series

- [**The Engineer's Playbook**](./the-engineers-playbook/README.md) - 43 comprehensive tutorials covering fundamental data structures, algorithms, and system design patterns from first principles

## Tutorial Series

### Frontend Development

## How It Works

1. **Code Analysis**: Claude AI reads examples and documentation from well-written, professional codebases
2. **Tutorial Generation**: Using specialized prompts (like the one in `@frontend/tanstack-router/PROMPT.md`), Claude generates educational content that provides useful explanations and insights
3. **Complementary Learning**: Each tutorial includes links to original examples and serves as supplementary material to help developers better understand the source codebase

## Philosophy

These tutorials follow a Feynman-inspired teaching approach:
- Break complex concepts into intuitive understanding
- Focus on the "why" behind design decisions  
- Provide practical, hands-on examples
- Build durable mental models for long-term retention

Each tutorial is designed to be a self-contained lesson that starts with a problem, walks through the code solution, and ends with actionable insights you can apply to your own projects.
