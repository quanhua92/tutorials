# Fred.rs Tutorials

A comprehensive tutorial series for the Fred Redis client library, designed to take you from basic concepts to production-ready implementations.

## Philosophy

These tutorials follow the **Feynman Teaching Method** - explaining complex concepts through simple analogies and building deep, intuitive understanding. Each tutorial focuses on the "why" behind Redis patterns, not just the "how."

## Learning Path

### üöÄ **Getting Started**
Start here if you're new to Fred or want to understand the fundamentals:

1. **[Basic Redis Client](01-basic-redis-client.md)**
   - Your first connection to Redis
   - Client configuration and initialization
   - Type-safe command execution
   - Error handling patterns

2. **[Client Pools](02-client-pools.md)**
   - Scaling connections for high throughput
   - Round-robin load balancing
   - When to use pools vs single clients

### üì° **Communication Patterns**
Learn Redis's core communication paradigms:

3. **[Publish-Subscribe](03-publish-subscribe.md)**
   - Real-time messaging patterns
   - Channel subscriptions and message handling
   - Surviving network interruptions
   - Regular clients vs SubscriberClient

4. **[Redis Streams](06-redis-streams.md)**
   - Event-driven architecture with persistence
   - Producer-consumer patterns
   - Message replay and ordering guarantees
   - Task communication in async applications

### ‚ö° **Performance & Consistency**
Master Redis's advanced execution patterns:

5. **[Transactions](04-transactions.md)**
   - Atomic operations with MULTI/EXEC
   - When to use transactions vs alternatives
   - Type-safe result handling

6. **[Pipelining](05-pipelining.md)**
   - Optimizing network round-trips
   - Batch command execution
   - Error handling in pipelines

7. **[Lua Scripting](07-lua-scripting.md)**
   - Server-side logic execution
   - Atomic complex operations
   - Script caching and management
   - Redis Functions for modern deployments

### üîç **Data Discovery & Management**
Learn to work with large keyspaces efficiently:

8. **[Scanning Keys](08-scanning-keys.md)**
   - Safe keyspace iteration
   - Memory-conscious vs high-throughput scanning
   - Cluster scanning patterns
   - Custom cursor management

### üè≠ **Production Deployment**
Advanced features for real-world applications:

9. **[Advanced Features](09-advanced-features.md)**
   - TLS security configuration
   - Sentinel high availability
   - Monitoring and debugging tools
   - Dynamic connection scaling
   - Web framework integration
   - JSON data handling
   - Custom protocol access

## Tutorial Structure

Each tutorial follows a consistent three-part structure:

### **Part 1: The Core Concept**
- **The Problem**: What real-world challenge does this feature solve?
- **The Solution**: How Redis and Fred address this problem
- **Mental Framework**: High-level understanding before diving into code

### **Part 2: Practical Walkthrough**
- **Code Analysis**: Line-by-line explanation of example code
- **Key Concepts**: Important patterns and techniques demonstrated
- **Type Safety**: How Fred's Rust interface provides compile-time guarantees

### **Part 3: Mental Models & Deep Dives**
- **Analogies**: Real-world comparisons to make abstract concepts concrete
- **Design Rationale**: Why Redis and Fred work the way they do
- **Further Exploration**: Experiments and modifications to deepen understanding

## How to Use These Tutorials

### **If You're New to Redis:**
Start with tutorials 1-2 to understand basic concepts, then explore communication patterns (3-4) before diving into performance features.

### **If You Know Redis But Not Fred:**
Focus on the "Practical Walkthrough" sections to see Fred's Rust-specific patterns, especially type safety and async handling.

### **If You're Building Production Applications:**
Start with the basics but quickly move to tutorials 7-9, which cover patterns essential for production deployments.

### **If You're Performance-Focused:**
Tutorials 5-6 (Pipelining, Scripting) and sections of tutorial 9 (Dynamic Pools, Replica Scaling) will be most relevant.

## Example Code

All tutorial examples are based on the actual example files in the Fred repository at `/examples/`. You can run any example with:

```bash
cargo run --example basic
cargo run --features="subscriber-client" --example pubsub
cargo run --features="i-all" --example scan
```

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Type Safety**: How Fred leverages Rust's type system for Redis operations
- **Async Patterns**: Tokio integration and concurrent operation handling
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management in distributed systems
- **Performance**: Connection pooling, pipelining, and scaling strategies
- **Production Readiness**: Security, monitoring, and operational concerns
- **Protocol Understanding**: When to use low-level vs high-level interfaces

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while following these tutorials:

1. **Check Feature Flags**: Many examples require specific Cargo features
2. **Redis Version**: Some features require specific Redis versions
3. **Network Setup**: Ensure Redis is accessible at the configured endpoints
4. **Dependencies**: Verify all required dependencies are in your Cargo.toml
