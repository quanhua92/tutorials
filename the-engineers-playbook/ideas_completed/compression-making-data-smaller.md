# Compression: Making Data Smaller ü§è


* **`01-concepts-01-the-core-problem.md`**: Addresses the fundamental issue that data consumes space and bandwidth, which are finite and costly resources.
* **`01-concepts-02-the-guiding-philosophy.md`**: Exploit redundancy. The core philosophy is that data is rarely random; it contains patterns. Compression algorithms find these patterns and represent them more efficiently. Analogy: Creating a personal shorthand for long words you write frequently.
* **`01-concepts-03-key-abstractions.md`**: Defines `lossless` (perfect reconstruction) vs. `lossy` (approximation) compression, and introduces the concept of an encoding `dictionary`.
* **`02-guides-01-getting-started.md`**: A practical guide to using a standard library (like `zlib` in Python) to compress a string of text and then decompress it, verifying the result.
* **`03-deep-dive-01-the-space-vs-cpu-trade-off.md`**: Explores the universal trade-off in compression. Higher compression ratios almost always require more computational power. Analogy: Deciding how much time to spend packing a suitcase to make it as compact as possible.
