- LLM selection criteria for agentic systems (reasoning, tool-calling, context, cost)
- Framework comparison (OpenAI Agents SDK vs. alternatives)
- Prompt engineering principles for autonomous behavior
- Introduction to multi-agent system architectures

**Key Insight**: Agentic AI isn't just "better AI"‚Äîit's a fundamentally different architecture based on goal-oriented autonomy rather than request-response patterns.

### Phase 2: Technical Foundations
**Goal**: Master the APIs and technical building blocks that power modern agents

#### ‚ö° Tutorial 2: OpenAI API Fundamentals
**File**: `02-openai-api-fundamentals.md`

- Agent identity and persistent behavior patterns
- Tool integration (function tools vs. hosted tools)
- Multi-agent handoff mechanisms for task delegation
- Observability and debugging autonomous systems

**Key Insight**: Modern agents are not just configured language models‚Äîthey're autonomous systems with persistent identity, tool capabilities, and collaboration mechanisms.

### Phase 4: Theoretical Foundations
**Goal**: Understand the cognitive science and AI theory behind autonomous behavior

#### üß† Tutorial 4: Agentic Foundations and Theory
**File**: `04-agentic-foundations-and-theory.md`
**What You'll Learn**:
- Five types of AI agents (reflex ‚Üí model-based ‚Üí goal-based ‚Üí utility-based ‚Üí learning)
- ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) architectural patterns
- Chain-of-Thought reasoning for complex problem solving
- Multi-agent coordination and communication strategies
- Cognitive architectures for autonomous intelligence

**Key Insight**: Agentic AI systems mirror cognitive architectures, progressing from simple reflexes to sophisticated learning systems that can adapt and improve over time.

### Phase 5: Integration and Interoperability
**Goal**: Understand how agents communicate and collaborate across systems

#### üåê Tutorial 5: AI Protocols and Interoperability
**File**: `05-ai-protocols-and-interoperability.md`
**What You'll Learn**:

- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool integration
- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol for direct agent communication
- llms.txt standard for responsible AI interaction boundaries
- Building the foundation for the "agent economy"

**Key Insight**: Just as the internet required open standards to scale globally, the agentic AI ecosystem needs standardized protocols to enable seamless collaboration between agents from different vendors and platforms.

### Phase 6: Architectural Mastery
**Goal**: Design robust, scalable multi-agent systems using proven patterns

#### üèóÔ∏è Tutorial 6: Agentic Design Patterns
**File**: `06-agentic-design-patterns.md`
**What You'll Learn**:
- Core agentic patterns (Reflection, Tool Use, Planning, MultiAgent)
- Anthropic workflow patterns (Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, Orchestrator-Workers)
- Multi-agent architectures (Hierarchical, Network, Sequential, Human-in-the-Loop)
- Pattern selection criteria and trade-offs
- Combining patterns for complex workflows

**Key Insight**: Design patterns provide proven, reusable solutions to common problems in agentic system architecture, enabling reliable and maintainable autonomous AI systems.
