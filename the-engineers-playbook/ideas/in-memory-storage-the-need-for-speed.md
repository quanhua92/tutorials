# In-Memory Storage: The Need for Speed ðŸš€


* **`01-concepts-01-the-core-problem.md`**: Disk is slow. How do we build systems that respond in microseconds, not milliseconds?
* **`01-concepts-02-the-guiding-philosophy.md`**: Keep data in RAM. The philosophy is to trade the durability and size of disk storage for the raw speed of memory access.
* **`01-concepts-03-key-abstractions.md`**: Key-value stores, data structures in memory. Analogy: Working with papers on your desk (RAM) versus fetching them from a filing cabinet in the basement (disk).
* **`02-guides-01-getting-started.md`**: A "hello world" for an in-memory database like Redis. Show setting a key, getting a key, and observing the speed.
* **`03-deep-dive-01-the-persistence-problem.md`**: What happens if the power goes out? Explores strategies for persisting in-memory data to disk (snapshotting, AOF) to get the best of both worlds.
