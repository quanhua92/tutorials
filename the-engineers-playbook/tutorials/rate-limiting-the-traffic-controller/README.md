# Rate Limiting: The Traffic Controller

## Summary

Rate limiting is a critical defensive technique that protects services from being overwhelmed by controlling the rate of incoming requests. Just like a traffic controller manages the flow of vehicles to prevent gridlock, rate limiting manages the flow of requests to prevent system overload.

This tutorial explores rate limiting from first principles, covering the core problem it solves, the philosophy behind effective rate limiting, key abstractions, practical implementation approaches, and deep technical comparisons of different algorithms.
