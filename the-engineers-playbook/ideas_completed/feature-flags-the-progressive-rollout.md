# Feature Flags: The Progressive Rollout üéöÔ∏è


* **`01-concepts-01-the-core-problem.md`**: Deploying new features to all users simultaneously is risky. How can you test features with real users, roll back instantly if problems arise, and gradually increase exposure?
* **`01-concepts-02-the-guiding-philosophy.md`**: Separate deployment from release. Code can be deployed to production but hidden behind flags, allowing fine-grained control over who sees what features when.
* **`01-concepts-03-key-abstractions.md`**: The `flag`, `targeting rules`, and `rollout percentage`. **Analogy**: A theater with dimmer switches. Instead of flipping all lights on at once, you gradually increase brightness, watching audience reaction and adjusting as needed.
* **`02-guides-01-implementing-feature-flags.md`**: Build a simple feature flag system showing how to enable features for specific users or percentages of traffic.
* **`03-deep-dive-01-flag-debt-and-lifecycle.md`**: The hidden cost of feature flags: complexity growth, testing permutations, and strategies for flag hygiene and retirement.
