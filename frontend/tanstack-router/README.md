## Tutorial Structure

Each tutorial follows a consistent three-part structure:

### Part 1: The Core Concept
- **The Problem**: What fundamental challenge does this example solve?
- **The TanStack Solution**: How does TanStack Router/Start address this problem?

### Part 2: Practical Walkthrough  
- **File-by-File Analysis**: Guided tour through the example's code
- **Annotated Code Snippets**: Real code with explanations of the "why"
- **Connecting the Dots**: How components work together

### Part 3: Mental Models & Deep Dives
- **Build the Mental Model**: Intuitive understanding through analogies
- **Design Philosophy**: Why the API is designed this way
- **Further Exploration**: Hands-on experiments to deepen understanding

## Learning Path

The tutorials are ordered from basic concepts to advanced patterns. Start with the Router fundamentals, then explore specific features, and finally dive into Start's full-stack capabilities.
