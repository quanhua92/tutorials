# Heap Data Structures: The Priority Expert

## Summary

Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that efficiently maintain priority ordering. Unlike fully sorted structures, heaps maintain just enough order to guarantee instant access to the highest (or lowest) priority element. Implemented as arrays with simple arithmetic for navigation, heaps power priority queues, heap sort, and numerous algorithms requiring efficient priority management.
