# LSM Trees: Making Writes Fast Again

## Summary

Traditional B-tree-based storage engines optimize for reads but suffer from poor write performance due to random I/O patterns. Log-Structured Merge Trees (LSM Trees) revolutionize database storage by optimizing for write throughput through sequential I/O and deferred organization. This tutorial explores how LSM Trees achieve high write performance and the trade-offs involved.
