# TanStack Query Tutorial Series

> **Learn TanStack Query from first principles through practical examples**

This tutorial series takes you from basic data fetching to advanced patterns through hands-on exploration of real examples. Each tutorial is based on a working example from the TanStack Query repository, ensuring you learn practical, battle-tested patterns.

## Learning Philosophy

These tutorials follow the **Feynman Approach** to learning:
- **Deconstruct Complexity**: Break down each pattern to its fundamental purpose
- **Use Intuitive Analogies**: Connect abstract concepts to familiar mental models  
- **Focus on the 'Why'**: Understand not just how things work, but why they're designed that way
- **Assume Intelligence**: Dive deep into concepts while explaining clearly

## Tutorial Structure

Each tutorial follows a consistent format:
1. **The Core Concept**: Why this pattern exists and what problem it solves
2. **Practical Walkthrough**: Step-by-step code breakdown with explanations
3. **Mental Model**: Deep understanding of the underlying concepts and design principles
