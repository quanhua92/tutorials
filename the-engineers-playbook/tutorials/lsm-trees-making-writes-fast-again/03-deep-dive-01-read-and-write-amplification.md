# Read and Write Amplification: Understanding the Trade-offs

## The Price of Performance

LSM Trees achieve excellent write performance by accepting two forms of amplification: **read amplification** and **write amplification**. Understanding these trade-offs is crucial for designing effective LSM-based systems.

## Write Amplification: The Hidden Cost of Organization

Write amplification occurs when a single logical write results in multiple physical writes to storage.

### Sources of Write Amplification

#### 1. MemTable Flushes
```
Logical: Insert 1KB key-value pair
Physical: 
  - Write to WAL: 1KB
  - Eventually flush entire MemTable: 64MB
  
Write amplification: 64x for this operation
```

#### 2. Compaction Cascades
```
Initial state:
  Level 0: [1MB] [1MB] [1MB] [1MB]
  Level 1: [10MB] [10MB] 

Compaction triggers:
  1. Merge Level 0 files: Read 4MB, Write 4MB
  2. Merge with Level 1: Read 20MB, Write 20MB
  
Total I/O: 48MB for 4MB of logical data
Write amplification: 12x
```

#### 3. Multi-Level Compaction
```
Level 0 ‚Üí Level 1: Data written once
Level 1 ‚Üí Level 2: Same data written again  
Level 2 ‚Üí Level 3: Same data written again

Total: Each byte written 3+ times through its lifetime
```

### Measuring Write Amplification

```
Write Amplification = Physical Bytes Written / Logical Bytes Written

Example over 1 hour:
  Logical writes: 1GB of user data
  Physical writes: 3.5GB (including compaction)
  Write amplification: 3.5x
```

### Write Amplification in Different Compaction Strategies

#### Size-Tiered Compaction
```
Amplification per level: ~2x (merge files of same size)
Total amplification: 2 √ó log(data_size/memtable_size)
Typical: 6-10x for large datasets
```

#### Leveled Compaction  
```
Amplification per level: ~10x (one file merges with 10 files)
Total amplification: 10 √ó num_levels
Typical: 20-30x for large datasets
```

## Read Amplification: The Lookup Tax

Read amplification occurs when a single logical read requires multiple physical reads.

### Sources of Read Amplification

#### 1. Multiple Source Checks
```
Read query for key "user:12345":
  1. Check MemTable (1 operation)
  2. Check SSTable-001 (1 disk read + index lookup)
  3. Check SSTable-002 (1 disk read + index lookup)  
  4. Check SSTable-003 (1 disk read + index lookup)
  
Result: 1 logical read = 4 physical operations
```

#### 2. Index and Data Block Reads
```
SSTable read for one key:
  1. Read index block (4KB)
  2. Read data block (64KB)
  
Total: 68KB read for a 100-byte value
Read amplification: 680x
```

#### 3. Bloom Filter Misses
```
Query for non-existent key:
  Without Bloom filter: Check every SSTable
  With Bloom filter: Skip most SSTables
  
Bloom filter false positive rate: 1%
Read amplification reduction: 99%
```

### Read Amplification Formula

```
Read Amplification = 
  (Avg SSTables checked) √ó (Blocks per SSTable lookup)

Factors:
  - Number of SSTables: More files = more checks
  - Key distribution: Hot vs cold data
  - Bloom filter effectiveness: Reduces unnecessary reads
  - Cache hit rates: Block cache reduces disk reads
```

## The Fundamental Trade-off

LSM Trees make a conscious trade-off between read and write performance:

| Metric | Traditional B-Tree | LSM Tree | Winner |
|--------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| Write Latency | High (random I/O) | **Low** (sequential) | üèÜ LSM |
| Write Throughput | Low (bottleneck) | **High** (append-only) | üèÜ LSM |
| Read Latency | **Low** (direct access) | Medium (multiple files) | üèÜ B-Tree |
| Read Throughput | **High** (indexed) | Medium (amplification) | üèÜ B-Tree |
| Space Amplification | **Low** (in-place) | Medium (duplication) | üèÜ B-Tree |

```

## Compaction Strategy Impact

Different compaction strategies optimize for different scenarios:

### Size-Tiered Compaction

**Write amplification**: Lower (2-10x)  
**Read amplification**: Higher (more overlapping files)  
**Best for**: Write-heavy workloads

### Leveled Compaction

**Read amplification**: Lower (no overlapping files)  
**Best for**: Read-heavy workloads

## Real-World Performance Analysis

### Write-Heavy Workload (Time-Series Data)

```
Workload: 100k writes/sec, 1k reads/sec
Configuration: Size-tiered compaction

Results:
  Write latency: P99 < 1ms
  Write amplification: 4x
  Read latency: P99 < 50ms  
  Read amplification: 8x

Verdict: Excellent for this use case
```

### Read-Heavy Workload (User Profiles)

```
Workload: 10k writes/sec, 100k reads/sec
Configuration: Leveled compaction + aggressive caching

Results:
  Write latency: P99 < 10ms
  Write amplification: 25x
  Read latency: P99 < 5ms
  Read amplification: 2x

Verdict: Good with proper tuning
```

## Mitigation Strategies

### Reducing Write Amplification

#### 1. Larger MemTables
```
Small MemTable (8MB): Frequent flushes, more SSTables
Large MemTable (256MB): Less frequent flushes, fewer SSTables

Trade-off: Memory usage vs write amplification
```

#### 2. Compaction Tuning
```
# RocksDB example
max_bytes_for_level_base = 256MB     # Larger base level
max_bytes_for_level_multiplier = 8   # Slower level growth
level0_file_num_compaction_trigger = 8  # More L0 files before compaction
```

#### 3. Write Buffer Optimization
```
# Multiple write buffers
min_write_buffer_number_to_merge = 2
max_write_buffer_number = 6

Effect: Reduces flush frequency, increases write batching
```

### Reducing Read Amplification

#### 1. Aggressive Caching
```
Block cache: Cache frequently accessed data blocks
Index cache: Cache SSTable indexes in memory
Bloom filter cache: Keep filters in memory

Memory trade-off: More cache = fewer disk reads
```

#### 2. Bloom Filter Tuning
```
bits_per_key = 10    # 1% false positive rate
bits_per_key = 20    # 0.01% false positive rate

Trade-off: Memory usage vs read amplification
```

#### 3. Compaction Strategy
```
# Leveled for read-heavy
compaction_style = level

# Size-tiered for write-heavy  
compaction_style = universal
```

## Monitoring Amplification in Production

### Key Metrics to Track

```python
# Write amplification
write_amplification = bytes_written_to_disk / bytes_written_by_user

# Read amplification  
read_amplification = disk_reads_per_query / logical_reads_per_query

# Compaction overhead
compaction_cpu_percent = compaction_cpu_time / total_cpu_time
compaction_io_percent = compaction_bytes / total_io_bytes
```

### Application Examples

**Time-series database** (Prometheus, InfluxDB):
- Mostly writes, occasional range queries
- Choice: Size-tiered compaction
- Accept: Higher read latency for blazing write speed

**User profile store** (Social media):  
- Frequent profile reads, occasional updates
- Choice: Leveled compaction + caching
- Accept: Higher write cost for consistent read performance

**Event sourcing system**:
- Append-only writes, replay reads
- Choice: Write-optimized with periodic snapshots
- Accept: Complex read path for simple write path

## The Bigger Picture

Amplification in LSM Trees reflects a fundamental principle in systems design: **you can't optimize everything simultaneously**.

The key insight is that LSM Trees make the trade-offs **explicit and configurable**, allowing system designers to optimize for their specific workload patterns.

**Understanding these trade-offs enables informed decisions about**:
- ü§î When to use LSM Trees vs other storage engines
- ‚öôÔ∏è How to configure compaction strategies  
- üíª What hardware to provision (more memory for caching, faster SSDs for compaction)
- üéØ How to set performance expectations
- üìä How to monitor and alert on system health
