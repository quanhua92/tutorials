# Lockless Data Structures: Concurrency Without Waiting

## Summary

Traditional locking mechanisms can create bottlenecks, deadlocks, and performance issues in multi-threaded applications. Lockless data structures use atomic operations and clever algorithms to enable safe concurrent access without blocking threads. This tutorial explores the fundamental concepts, practical implementations, and trade-offs of lock-free programming.
