# Trie Structures: The Autocomplete Expert ðŸ”¤


* **`01-concepts-01-the-core-problem.md`**: How do you build a system that can instantly suggest all words or keys starting with a given prefix (e.g., "dev")? A standard hash map or sorted list is inefficient for this.
* **`01-concepts-02-the-guiding-philosophy.md`**: Share common prefixes. A trie (or prefix tree) is a tree structure where each path from the root represents a key. By their nature, keys with the same prefix share the same initial path in the tree.
* `01-concepts-03-key-abstractions.md`: `Nodes`, `edges` (representing characters), and the `end-of-word` marker. Analogy: A specialized dictionary where you trace words letter by letter. To find all words starting with "ca", you follow the 'c' path, then the 'a' path, and explore everything from there.
* **`02-guides-01-building-an-autocomplete.md`**: A simple guide to implementing a trie in Python to store a list of words, then writing a function to find all words given a prefix.
* **`03-deep-dive-01-tries-vs-hash-maps.md`**: A deep dive into the performance and memory trade-offs. Tries can be more memory-efficient than hash maps when many keys share long prefixes.
