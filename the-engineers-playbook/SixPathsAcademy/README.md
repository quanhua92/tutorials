# SixPathsAcademy.com - Master Development Plan

> **Master all dimensions of software engineering through six complementary paths**

## 🎯 Project Overview

SixPathsAcademy.com is a gamified learning platform that transforms The Engineer's Playbook into an interactive, community-driven experience. Built with React, TanStack Router, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI, it enables developers to track their progress through the Six Paths of Software Engineering while building a community around shared learning.

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

### **Decentralized Progress Tracking**
- Each developer owns their learning journey via forked repositories
- Personal progress stored in JSON files within their own repos
- Client-only application deployable to Vercel
- No vendor lock-in - developers control their data

### **Community-Driven Learning**
- Peer comparison through GitHub repo crawling
- Favorites system for following other developers
- Optional global rankings for competitive learning
- Social features that encourage knowledge sharing

### **Lightweight & Scalable**
- Static site generation for maximum performance
- Zero database dependencies - fully Git-based architecture
- Edge-first deployment strategy
- Cost-effective scaling through static hosting
