# Distributed Tracing: The Request Detective

*Making the invisible visible in distributed systems*

## Summary

Distributed tracing is the practice of tracking requests as they flow through multiple services in a distributed system. Think of it as a GPS tracker for your requests - showing you exactly where each request went, how long it spent in each service, and where problems occurred.

In monolithic applications, debugging is straightforward: you have one codebase, one log file, and one call stack. But in microservices, a single user request might touch dozens of services. When something goes wrong, finding the root cause becomes like solving a mystery scattered across multiple crime scenes.

Distributed tracing solves this by creating a "fingerprint" for each request that flows through your entire system. Every service the request touches adds its own "stamp" to this fingerprint, creating a complete picture of the request's journey.

## Why This Matters

- **Debugging becomes investigation**: Instead of guessing where problems occur, you can see the exact path and timing
- **Performance optimization**: Identify bottlenecks across service boundaries
- **System understanding**: Visualize how your microservices actually interact
- **Incident response**: Reduce mean time to resolution from hours to minutes
