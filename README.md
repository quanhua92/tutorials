# AI-Generated Developer Tutorials

This repository contains AI-generated tutorials created using Claude AI models to make complex codebases and documentation more accessible. The goal is to distill advanced concepts into clear, practical learning resources that complement original documentation.

## How It Works

1. **Code Analysis**: Claude AI reads examples and documentation from well-written, professional codebases
2. **Tutorial Generation**: Using specialized prompts (like the one in `@frontend/tanstack-router/PROMPT.md`), Claude generates educational content that provides useful explanations and insights
3. **Complementary Learning**: Each tutorial includes links to original examples and serves as supplementary material to help developers better understand the source codebase

## Tutorial Series

### Frontend Development
- [**TanStack Router & Start**](./frontend/tanstack-router/README.md) - Comprehensive tutorials covering TanStack Router and TanStack Start from first principles

*More tutorial series coming soon...*

## Philosophy

These tutorials follow a Feynman-inspired teaching approach:
- Break complex concepts into intuitive understanding
- Focus on the "why" behind design decisions  
- Provide practical, hands-on examples
- Build durable mental models for long-term retention

Each tutorial is designed to be a self-contained lesson that starts with a problem, walks through the code solution, and ends with actionable insights you can apply to your own projects.
