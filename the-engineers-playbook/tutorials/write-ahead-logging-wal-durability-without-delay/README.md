# Write-Ahead Logging (WAL): Durability without Delay ‚úçÔ∏è

Write-Ahead Logging is the foundational technique that enables databases to provide strong durability guarantees while maintaining excellent performance. By writing intentions before actions, WAL separates the promise of durability from the complexity of implementation.

## Summary

This tutorial explores how Write-Ahead Logging solves the fundamental tension between durability and performance in database systems. You'll learn why traditional approaches fail under load, how WAL's "intent before action" philosophy enables ACID guarantees, and the specific techniques that make production databases reliable.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Why durability and performance seem mutually exclusive and how WAL resolves this tension
- The philosophical shift from "perfect disk state" to "perfect replay-ability"
- How fsync(), LSNs, and commit protocols provide unbreakable durability guarantees
- Implementation techniques used in PostgreSQL, MySQL, and other production databases

**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of databases and file systems. Python knowledge helpful for the implementation sections but not required for understanding the concepts.
