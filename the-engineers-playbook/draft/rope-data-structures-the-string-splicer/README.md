# Rope Data Structures: The String Splicer ðŸ§µ

A Rope is a binary tree data structure that is used to efficiently store and manipulate long strings. It is particularly well-suited for applications that require frequent insertions and deletions in the middle of text, such as text editors.

This tutorial explores the core concepts behind Rope data structures, from the fundamental problem they solve to a practical implementation in Rust.
