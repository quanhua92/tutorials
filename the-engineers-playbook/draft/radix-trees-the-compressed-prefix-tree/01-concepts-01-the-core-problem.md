# The Core Problem: Sparse Tries Waste Memory

Imagine you're building an autocomplete system for a code editor. You need to store thousands of programming keywords, function names, and variable names—all starting with common prefixes like `get`, `set`, `handle`, or `process`.

A standard trie (prefix tree) seems perfect for this job. It stores strings efficiently by sharing common prefixes among multiple words. But there's a hidden inefficiency lurking beneath the surface.

## The Memory Waste Problem

Consider storing these three words in a standard trie:
- `developer`
- `development` 
- `devotion`

In a standard trie, you'd create a separate node for every single character:

```
root
└── d
    └── e
        └── v
            ├── e
            │   └── l
            │       └── o
            │           └── p
            │               └── e
            │                   └── r (END: "developer")
            │                       └── (empty)
            └── o
                └── t
                    └── i
                        └── o
                            └── n (END: "devotion")
```

Here's the problem: look at that long chain from `root → d → e → v`. Every node in this chain has exactly one child. We're using three separate node objects to store what's essentially just the string "dev".

**This is pure waste.**

## Real-World Impact

In production systems, this waste compounds rapidly:

1. **Memory Overhead**: Each node requires metadata (pointers, flags, etc.) beyond just storing a character
2. **Cache Inefficiency**: Traversing long chains means more pointer dereferencing and cache misses
3. **Allocation Overhead**: Creating thousands of single-child nodes puts pressure on memory allocators

Consider a dictionary containing words like:
- `internationalization`
- `internationalize` 
- `international`

The prefix `internation` creates a chain of 11 single-child nodes before reaching the first branch. That's 11 separate objects to store what could be a single string.

## The Fundamental Question

Why are we creating a separate node object for every character when many paths through our tree are just linear chains with no branching?

**The answer**: We shouldn't. This is where radix trees enter the picture.

The core insight is simple: **compress the chains**. Instead of storing one character per node, store entire strings along the edges between nodes. Only create nodes where the tree actually branches.

This transforms our memory-hungry chain of single-child nodes into a compact, efficient structure that achieves the same functionality with dramatically less overhead.
