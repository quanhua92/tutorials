# Vector Databases: The Similarity Search Engine

**Transform the fuzzy concept of "similarity" into precise, high-performance geometric operations.**

## Summary

Vector databases solve a fundamental problem that traditional databases cannot: finding items "similar" to a given item at scale. By representing data as high-dimensional vectors and using sophisticated indexing algorithms, they enable applications like recommendation systems, search engines, and AI-powered features that rely on semantic similarity rather than exact matches.

This tutorial series explores vector databases from first principles, covering the mathematical foundations, practical implementation patterns, and real-world applications. You'll learn how to think geometrically about data, implement efficient similarity search algorithms, and build production-ready vector search systems.
