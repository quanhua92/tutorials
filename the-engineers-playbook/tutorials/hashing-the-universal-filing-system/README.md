# Hashing: The Universal Filing System

> *"The best data structure is the one that eliminates the need to search."*

Hashing transforms the fundamental problem of data retrieval from "Where is my data?" to "Where should my data be?" This conceptual shift‚Äîfrom searching to calculating‚Äîpowers everything from Python dictionaries to distributed databases.

## Summary

This tutorial explores hashing through the lens of a universal filing system. Rather than organizing data to make searching easier, hashing calculates exactly where data belongs using mathematical functions. We cover the core abstractions (keys, values, hash functions, and buckets), handle the inevitable collisions, and manage performance through load factors and resizing.

You'll build intuitive understanding through analogies (postal systems, hotel occupancy), then implement a complete hash table in Rust to see how theory becomes high-performance code.

## Table of Contents

### üìö Part 1: Core Concepts
- **[The Core Problem](01-concepts-01-the-core-problem.md)** - Why finding specific data in vast collections is fundamentally hard, and how hashing solves this through calculation instead of search.

- **[The Guiding Philosophy](01-concepts-02-the-guiding-philosophy.md)** - The philosophical shift from "organize then search" to "calculate the location," including the trade-offs we accept for performance.

- **[Key Abstractions](01-concepts-03-key-abstractions.md)** - The four pillars of hashing: keys (identifiers), values (payload), hash functions (oracle calculators), and buckets (storage containers).

### üõ†Ô∏è Part 2: Practical Guides  
- **[Getting Started](02-guides-01-getting-started.md)** - Build your first hash table phonebook in Python, JavaScript, and Java. See what happens under the hood and compare performance with linear search.

### üî¨ Part 3: Deep Dives
- **[Collision Resolution](03-deep-dive-01-collision-resolution.md)** - What happens when different keys want the same bucket? Explore chaining, open addressing, linear probing, quadratic probing, and Robin Hood hashing.

- **[Load Factor and Resizing](03-deep-dive-02-load-factor-and-resizing.md)** - The critical balance between memory usage and performance. When to resize, how to rehash, and why load factor is your hash table's vital sign.

### üíª Part 4: Implementation
- **[Rust Implementation](04-rust-implementation.md)** - Build a production-ready hash table from scratch in Rust, featuring memory safety, generic types, iterators, concurrent access, and performance optimizations.
