# Axum Tutorials: From First Principles

Welcome to the comprehensive Axum tutorial series! This collection teaches you to build robust, production-ready web applications using Axum—a web framework that focuses on ergonomics, modularity, and leveraging Rust's powerful type system.

## What Makes Axum Different

Axum stands apart from other web frameworks through its **composable architecture**. Instead of providing its own middleware system, Axum builds on the proven [`tower`](https://crates.io/crates/tower) ecosystem. This means you get timeouts, tracing, compression, authorization, and more—for free. It also enables you to share middleware with applications built using [`hyper`](https://crates.io/crates/hyper) or [`tonic`](https://crates.io/crates/tonic).

### Core Philosophy

Axum follows three guiding principles:

1. **Ergonomic API**: Route requests to handlers with a macro-free API
2. **Type-Safe Extraction**: Declaratively parse requests using extractors that prevent runtime errors
3. **Tower Integration**: Take full advantage of the mature Rust async ecosystem

## Tutorial Series Overview

Each tutorial builds on the previous ones, moving from fundamental concepts to advanced patterns:

### 1. [Hello World: Your First Axum Web Server](./01-hello-world.md)
**Core Concept**: Basic request-response handling  
**Key Takeaways**: Router setup, handler functions, response types

Start here to understand Axum's minimal surface area. Learn how three key components—Router, handlers, and the async runtime—create a complete web server in just a few lines of code.

### 2. [Routes and Handlers: Organizing Your Web Application](./02-routes-and-handlers-close-together.md)
**Core Concept**: Modular route organization  
**Key Takeaways**: Router composition, the merge pattern, keeping related code together

Discover how to structure applications for maintainability. Learn to build complex routing systems by composing smaller, focused routers.

### 3. [Extractors and Responses: The Heart of Axum's Type System](./03-extractors-and-responses.md)
**Core Concept**: Type-safe request parsing and response generation  
**Key Takeaways**: JSON extraction, automatic error handling, response composition

Master Axum's most powerful feature: extractors that automatically convert HTTP data into Rust types, and response types that handle serialization and header management.

### 4. [Error Handling: Building Resilient Web Applications](./04-error-handling.md)
**Core Concept**: Unified error handling and consistent user experience  
**Key Takeaways**: Custom error types, the `?` operator, `IntoResponse` trait

Learn to build applications that fail gracefully. Understand how Rust's type system and Axum's traits create bulletproof error handling without sacrificing performance.

### 5. [Middleware from Functions: Intercepting the Request-Response Flow](./05-middleware-from-functions.md)
**Core Concept**: Cross-cutting concerns and request transformation  
**Key Takeaways**: Middleware layers, request/response inspection, async composition

Explore how to add functionality that applies across multiple routes: logging, authentication, rate limiting, and more.

### 6. [Dependency Injection and State: Building Testable, Maintainable Applications](./06-dependency-injection-and-state.md)
**Core Concept**: Decoupling components and enabling testability  
**Key Takeaways**: Trait objects vs generics, application state, testing strategies

Learn to build applications where components depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, making testing and maintenance dramatically easier.

### 7. [WebSockets: Real-Time Bidirectional Communication](./07-websockets-and-real-time-communication.md)
**Core Concept**: Moving beyond request-response to persistent connections  
**Key Takeaways**: Protocol upgrades, concurrent bidirectional messaging, connection lifecycle management

Master real-time web applications: chat systems, live updates, collaborative editing, and streaming data.

## How to Use These Tutorials

### If You're New to Axum
Start with tutorial 1 and work through sequentially. Each tutorial assumes knowledge from the previous ones.

### If You're Experienced with Web Development
Focus on tutorials 3-7, which cover Axum-specific patterns and advanced async Rust concepts.

### If You're Building a Specific Feature
- **API endpoints**: Tutorials 1, 3, 4
- **Authentication/middleware**: Tutorials 5, 6
- **Real-time features**: Tutorial 7
- **Large applications**: Tutorials 2, 4, 6

## The Feynman Method Applied

These tutorials follow Richard Feynman's teaching philosophy: **if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough**. Each tutorial:

- **Starts with the problem**: Why does this pattern exist?
- **Explains the solution**: How does Axum address this problem?
- **Provides working code**: Copy-paste-ready examples from the Axum repository
- **Builds mental models**: Analogies and diagrams that make abstract concepts concrete
- **Encourages exploration**: Specific suggestions for extending the examples

## Beyond the Tutorials
