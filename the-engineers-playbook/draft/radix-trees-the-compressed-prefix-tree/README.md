# Radix Trees: The Compressed Prefix Tree

A comprehensive tutorial on radix trees (also known as PATRICIA tries or compressed tries), exploring how path compression transforms memory-hungry standard tries into efficient, production-ready data structures.

## Summary

Radix trees solve a fundamental problem with standard tries: memory waste from long chains of single-child nodes. By compressing these chains into single edges labeled with strings, radix trees achieve the same functionality as tries while using dramatically less memory and often delivering better performance.

This tutorial covers the theoretical foundations, practical implementation considerations, and real-world applications‚Äîparticularly focusing on IP routing tables where radix trees enable the modern internet's packet forwarding infrastructure.
