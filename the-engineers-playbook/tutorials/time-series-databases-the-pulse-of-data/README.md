# Time-Series Databases: The Pulse of Data üìà

Time-series databases are specialized systems designed for storing and querying data that changes over time. Unlike traditional relational databases, they treat time as a first-class citizen, optimizing everything around temporal patterns.

## Summary

This tutorial explores how time-series databases solve the unique challenges of temporal data through specialized architectures, compression techniques, and query optimizations. You'll learn why traditional databases struggle with time-series workloads and how purpose-built solutions achieve remarkable efficiency gains.
