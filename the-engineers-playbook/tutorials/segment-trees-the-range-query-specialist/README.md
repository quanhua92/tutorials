# Segment Trees: The Range Query Specialist

## Summary

Segment trees are specialized binary trees designed to efficiently answer range queries and perform range updates on arrays. When you need to repeatedly query the sum, minimum, maximum, or other aggregate functions over arbitrary ranges of an array‚Äîwhile also supporting updates‚Äîsegment trees provide O(log n) performance for both operations.

This tutorial explores segment trees from first principles, showing why naive approaches fail at scale, how the hierarchical pre-computation philosophy works, and providing a complete implementation that you can use in production scenarios like computational geometry, database query optimization, and real-time analytics.
