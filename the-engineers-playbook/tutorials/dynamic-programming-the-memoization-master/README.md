# Dynamic Programming: The Memoization Master

Transform exponential algorithms into polynomial ones by remembering what you've already computed. This tutorial series explores dynamic programming from first principles, building intuitive understanding through practical examples and real-world implementations.

## Summary

Dynamic programming solves optimization problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing solutions to avoid redundant computation. This technique transforms algorithms that would take exponential time (like naive Fibonacci) into polynomial time solutions, making previously impossible problems tractable.

The core insight is trading space for time: instead of recomputing the same subproblems repeatedly, we store results in a memoization table and reuse them. This simple concept enables dramatic performance improvements across diverse problem domains.
