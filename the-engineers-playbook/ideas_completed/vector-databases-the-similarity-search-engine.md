# Vector Databases: The Similarity Search Engine ðŸ§²


* **`01-concepts-01-the-core-problem.md`**: Traditional databases excel at exact matches but struggle with "find me items similar to this" queries, which are crucial for recommendation systems and AI applications.
* **`01-concepts-02-the-guiding-philosophy.md`**: Map data to geometric space. By representing items as high-dimensional vectors, similarity becomes a distance calculation, enabling efficient nearest-neighbor searches.
* **`01-concepts-03-key-abstractions.md`**: The `embedding`, `vector space`, and `similarity metric`. **Analogy**: A map where restaurants are plotted based on cuisine style and price. To find restaurants "similar" to your favorite, you just look for the nearest dots on the map.
* **`02-guides-01-building-image-search.md`**: Use a pre-trained model to convert images to vectors, store them, and implement visual similarity search.
* **`03-deep-dive-01-indexing-high-dimensions.md`**: Explores algorithms like LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) and HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) that make billion-scale similarity search feasible.
